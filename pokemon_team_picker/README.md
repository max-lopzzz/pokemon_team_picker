# Pokémon Team Picker
## Overview
Welcome to the Pokémon Gym Leader Challenge project! This program allows users to select a Pokémon game and gym leader, view the gym leader’s team, and prepare for battle. Currently, users can choose their generation, game, and gym, and see information about the corresponding gym leaders and their Pokémon.

## Current features
- **Load Game Generations:** Users can select their Pokémon generation and game.
- **Select a Gym:** Users can view and select from available gyms within their chosen game.
- **View Gym Leaders:** Displays information about gym leaders and their Pokémon.

## Upcoming features
We are looking for help to implement additional features that will enhance the gameplay experience. Specifically, we need assistance with the following:
1. User input for Pokémon:
- A program that allows users to input their Pokémon, including details such as type, level, and abilities.
2. Comparison functionality:
- A program that compares the user's Pokémon with the gym leader's Pokémon to determine potential matchups and strengths.
3. Team recommendation system:
- A program that analyzes the user's available Pokémon and suggests a team of the best six Pokémon (or fewer, if fewer than six are available) to combat the chosen gym leader effectively. This would involve calculations to determine type advantages, levels, and abilities.

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required CSV files: `generations.csv`, `gym_leaders.csv`, and `pokedex.csv` should be placed in the project directory.

### Installation:
1. Clone the repository:

2. Navigate into the project directory:
```
cd pokemon_team_picker

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from anyone interested in enhancing this project! If you have experience in Python programming and are interested in helping, here are a few specific areas where we need assistance:
1. **User Input for Pokémon:** Help us create a program that allows users to input their Pokémon, including details such as type, level, and abilities.
2. **Comparison Functionality:** Assist in developing a program that compares the user's Pokémon with the gym leader's Pokémon to identify strengths and weaknesses.
3. **Team Recommendation System:* Collaborate on creating a system that recommends the best six Pokémon (or fewer, if less are available) for users to challenge a gym leader based on type advantages, levels, and abilities.
